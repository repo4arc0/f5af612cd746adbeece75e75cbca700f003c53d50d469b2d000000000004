401
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,630
信不信由你  还做了猎头
believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

402

想找到一个配得上的继任者

Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

933
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:14,940

先生
Sir!

941
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,850
我要请你从甜甜圈上下来
I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut.

942
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,300
我告诉你我不想加入你的绝密男子组合了
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.

943
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,660
不不

944
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,500
瞧  我记得  你什么事都自己干
See, I remember, you do everything yourself.

945
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,960
-结果怎么样呢  -挺...
- How's that working out for you? - It's... It's... It's...

946
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,550
抱歉  我不想惹到你
I'm sorry. I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

947
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,250
我是该看眼罩还是眼睛
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

948
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,630
老实说  我有点宿醉
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

949
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,150
我都不确定你是真的  还是我...
I'm not sure if you're real or if I'm having...

950
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,380
我非常真实
I am very real.

951
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,870
我是你会认识的最真实的人
I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.

952

Just my luck. Where's the staff here?

953
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,300
那看上去不妙啊
That's not looking so good.

954
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,710
我经历过更糟的
I've been worse.

955
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,730
我们已封锁周边了
We've secured the perimeter,

956
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,890
但恐怕维持不了很久
but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.

957
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,060
你被解雇了
You're fired.

958
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,420
那不由你决定
That's not up to you.

959
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,280
托尼  这位是罗曼诺夫特工
Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

960
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,110

I'm a S.H.L.E.L.D. shadow.

961
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,060
我们发现你生病后
Once we knew you were ill,

962
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,100
弗瑞局长就派我潜到你身边
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

963
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,920
我建议你道歉
I suggest you apologize.

964
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,150
你最近很忙啊
You've been very busy.

965
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,080
让你女朋友当上执行总裁
You made your girl your CEO,

966
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,950
把东西都捐了出去
you're giving away all your stuff.

967
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,950
让你的朋友穿着你的战衣飞走了
You let your friend fly away with your suit.

968
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,410
如果我不了解...
Now, if I didn't know better...

969
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,540
你的确不了解  我没给他  是他自己夺的
You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.

970
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,240
他夺的
What? He took it?

971
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,540
你是钢铁侠  他想夺就夺了
You're Iron Man and he just took it'?

972
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,470
那位黑人兄弟走进去
The little brother walked in there,

973
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,620
扁了你一顿  然后夺了一件你的战衣
kicked your ass and took your suit?

974
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,510
这可能吗
Is that possible?

975
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,390
根据斯塔克先生的数据库安保指导
Well, according to Mr. Stark's database security guidelines,

976
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,430
有冗余规程防止未授权使用的
there are redundancies to prevent unauthorized usage.

977
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,160
-你们想要什么  -我们想要什么
- What do you want from me? - What do we want from you?

978
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,880
你想要什么
What do you want from me?

979
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,640
你已经成了个问题  而我得解决你这个问题
You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.

980
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,920
不管你怎么想  你不是我宇宙的中心
Contrary to your belief, you are not the center of my universe.

981
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,750
我在西南部
I have bigger problems

982

给他
Hit him.

984
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:25,650
天呐  你们要挖了我的肾去卖吗
Oh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

985
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,320
你能不能坚持五秒别干什么坏事
Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds?

986
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:33,350
-她刚对我做了什么  -我们刚为你做了什么
- What did she just do to me? - What did we just do for you?

987
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,850
那是二氧化锂  能缓解你的病症
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.

988
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,490
我们是想让你回去工作
We're trying to get you back to work.

989
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,900
给我几盒那玩意  我就没问题了
Give me a couple of boxes of that. I'll be right as rain.

990
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,970
不能治愈  只能缓解症状
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

991
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,550
看上去解决办法不会很简单的
Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.

992
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,620
相信我  我知道  我擅长这玩意的

每一种已知元素的排列方式
every permutation of every known element.

996
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,750
我要告诉你  你还没试全

我们把你的鸟拿来了  哥们
We got you the bird, pal.

1002

这不是我的鸟
This is not my bird.

1003
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:19,630

-很美  -从俄罗斯远道而来的
- It's a beautiful bird. - We got this all the way from Russia.

1007
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,210
我说这不是我的鸟
Hey, man, this not my bird.

1008
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,990
听着  就算不是

1009
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:35,100
这也是只很美的鸟
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

1010
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,140
别对身外物那么执迷嘛
I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things.

1011
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,620
学会放手
Learn to let go.

1012
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,700
等等  杰克  那是什么
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

1013

1015
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,290
杰克
Jack.

1016
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,970
那是头盔吗  我看不像
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

1017
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,600
这玩意要怎么戴在脑袋上
How... How are you supposed to get a head in there?

1018
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,460
-杰克  你的脑袋能放进去吗  -不能

See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there.

1022

这不是头盔
That's... That's not a helmet.

1023

而是脑袋  我得让人进去
It's a head. I need to put a guy in there.

1024
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:22,510
我得让战衣里能进个人  明白吗
I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

1025
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:25,000
-无人机更好  -什么  无人机更好

Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.

你说"没问题"的

你是跟我这么说的  你说"没问题"
That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem."

1032
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:44,660
我需要战衣  政府要战衣
Now I need suits. The government wants suits.

1033
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,780
就像钢铁侠  懂吗
Like Iron Man. You understand?

1034
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,300
那才是人们要的  那会让他们开心

1035
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,640

学会放手
Learn to let go.

1038
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,900
这些无人机最好能抢风头  伊凡
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

1039
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:08,930
明白吗  最好让我震撼  伊凡
You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

1040
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,230
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1041
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,230
这应该足以让参议院放过我了
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

1042
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:26,990
-可以用吗  -完全能执行任务
- It's functional? - Fully mission-capable.

Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.

1044
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,160
长官
Sir?

1045
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,250
贾斯汀·汉默要在博览会上进行武器展示
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.

1046
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,860
我们要用它进行介绍
We'd like this to introduce it.

1047
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,510
长官  我不觉得博览会
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

1048
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,440
中校  得尽快让世界看到它
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.

1049
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,510
-我们必须做到  -是  将军  但是
- We've got to make this happen. - Yes, General, but...

1050
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:46,520
这还是命令
It's also an order.

1051
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,080
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1052
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,520
好样的  中校  国家以你为傲

谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

1054
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:03,910
你胸口的那玩意是基于未完成的科技
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

1055
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,490
不  是完成的
No, it was finished.

1056
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,720
但此前并不是很高效
It has never been particularly effective

1057
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,220
直到我把它缩小  放进了我的...
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

1058
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,100
不  霍华德说方舟反应堆
No. Howard said the arc reactor

1059
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,230
是通向更伟大发明的垫脚石
was the stepping stone to something greater.

1060
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,970
他本来要开展能源竞赛
He was about to kick off an energy race

1061
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:18,290
把军备竞赛远远地比下去
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

1062
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,340
他在研究什么大项目
He was on to something big,

1063
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,920
大到能把核反应堆比得像
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor

1064
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,910
3A电池的东西
look like a triple-A battery.

1065
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,490
就他一人吗  还是安东·万科也参加了
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1066
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,690
安东·万科是硬币的另一面
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.

1067
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:32,790
安东把这视为生财之道
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1068
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:35,450
你父亲发现后  将他驱逐出境了
When your father found out, he had him deported.

1069
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,310
而当苏联发现他光说不能做时
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver,

1070
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:38,810
就把他送去了西伯利亚
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1071
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:41,860
接下来20年里  伏特加让他越来越愤怒
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1072
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,350
那并不是养孩子的好环境
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,

1073
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:48,430
你不幸在摩纳哥遭遇了他的儿子
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1074
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,380
你跟我说  我还没试全
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1075
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,530
什么意思  我没试全
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?

1076
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,560
我还有什么没试的
What haven't I tried?

1077
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,720
他说
He said that

1078
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,060
你是唯一有办法有知识
you were the only person with the means and knowledge

1079
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,760
完成他未竟事业的人
to finish what he started.

1080
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,080
这是他说的
He said that?

1081
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,020
你是那样的人吗  是吗
Are you that guy? Are you?

1082
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,880
因为如果你是
'Cause if you are,

1083
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,370
那你就能解决你心脏的谜题
then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

1084
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,490
我不知道你的情报哪来的
I don't know where you get your information,

1085
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,990
但他并没那么喜欢我
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1086
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,350
你对你爸爸都记得什么
What do you remember about your dad?

1087
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,240
他很冷漠  算计
He was cold, he was calculating.

1088
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,020
他从不对我说他爱我  甚至不说他喜欢我
He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,

1089
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,700
所以我有点难以相信
so it's a little tough for me to digest

1090
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,290
你说他曾说未来全靠我了
when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me

1091
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,320
还说他传承给我了  我不理解
and he's passing it down. I don't get that.

1092
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,510
这家伙最开心的一天
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day

1093
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,320
就是把我送去寄宿学校的那天
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

1094
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,250
才不是这样
That's not true.

1095
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,900
那你显然比我更了解我爸
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

1096
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:38,950
其实  还真是这样
As a matter of fact, I did.

- No, I'm not good. - You got this? Right? Right?

1102
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,580
可以什么  我根本没听明白

你还太小  现在不会理解
You're too young to understand this right now,

1220
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,460
所以我还是录下来给你看吧

我建这个是为了你

我受我现在时代的科技所限制
I'm limited by the technology of my time,

1226
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,730
但有一天你能解开它

你将能改变世界

1229
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,650
我这辈子  自始至终

1230
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,790
最伟大的创造

1231
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:47,930

1236
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,310
拿着吧  我不喜欢被人递东西
Take it. Take it. I don't like people handing me things.

1237
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,990
放在那里就好  很好
If you just drop that there, that'd be great.

1238
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,770
-你是钢铁侠吗  -有时候吧
- Are you Iron Man? - Sometimes.

1239

我们相信你

那是对商业资产的违法扣押

1244
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,600

1247
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,830
斯塔克先生宣布他就是钢铁侠时
When Mr. Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,

1248
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,860
他向美国做出了一个承诺

1249
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:56,470

Don't tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country

1263

还不许我提出诉讼
and then not let me pursue this.

1264

我会把这些东西搬走的

1272
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:31,610
拜托  你刚挂了电话
Come on, you just got off the phone.

1273
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,250

-29  28  -好吧  我...
- Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight. - Okay, I...

1275
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,130
我刚开车过来的
I was just driving over here,

1276
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,860
我本以为我是要来道歉的  但不是的
and I thought I was coming to basically apologize, but I'm not.

1277
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,590
-你不是来道歉的  -听着
- You didn't come here to apologize? - Look,

1278
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:44,610
这是不用说的
that goes without saying,

1279
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:46,320
我在努力了
and I'm working on that.

1280
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,330
但我没有完全对你说实话
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you,

1281
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,470
我想做正确的事
and I just want to try to make good.

1282
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,630
我能把这个挪开吗  简直疯了
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1283
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,050
简直像个摩天轮
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1284
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,770
-我还想...  -不行
- I'm trying to get some... - No.

1285
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,910
你知道人生多短吗
Do you know how short life is?

1286
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,730
如果我从没表达...
And if I never got to express...

1287
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,450
对了  这对我来说也挺有启示性
And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1288
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,900
我不在乎...我在乎的  那样就好了
And I don't care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1289
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,770
我不指望你...
I'm not expecting you to...

1290
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,020
我想说的是
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1291
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,930
-我直说了吧  -你打住吧
- I'm just gonna say it. - Let me stop you right here, okay?

1292
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,490
因为如果你再说一个"我"
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1293
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:20,520
我真的要拿什么东西砸你的脑袋了
I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.

1294
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,820
我在努力管理一家公司
I am trying to run a company.

1295
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:25,500
-你知道那都包括做什么吗  -知道
- Do you have any idea what that entails? - Yes.

1296
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,530
大家都指望着你做钢铁侠  而你却失踪了
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared,

1297
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,390
而我只能到处灭你的火
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires

1298
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,090
并为此承受压力
and taking the heat for it.

1299
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:38,260
我在尽力做本该你做的工作
I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.

1300
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,530
你是给我拿了草莓来吗
Did you bring me strawberries?

1301
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,760
你知道这世上我只对一样东西
Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth

1302
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,380
-过敏吗  -草莓过敏
- that I'm allergic to? - Allergic to strawberries.

1303
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:54,470
这是进步  派珀
This is progress, Pepper.

1304
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,850
我就知道你跟这玩意有点什么关联
I knew there was a correlation between you and this.

1305
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,610
-我需要你  -我也需要你
- I need you... - I need you, too.

1306
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:02,570
-马上离开  -我就是想说这个
- To leave now. - That's what I'm trying to...

1307
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,500
波茨小姐
Ms. Potts?

1308
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:13,380
-进来吧  -25分钟后动身
- Come on in. - Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1309

谢谢
Thank you.

1310
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,450
还需要什么吗  老板
Anything else, boss?

1311
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,080
-不用了  哈皮  -不用  我还需要
- I'm good, Hap. - No, I'll be just...

1312
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,170
一小会儿
another minute.

1313
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,040
这一离婚俩孩子都不跟我啊
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1314
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,010
不好吗
No.

1315
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,190
你在这里还适应吗  娜塔莉
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

1316
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,870
在斯塔克企业
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1317
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,020
你是叫娜塔莉  是吧
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1318
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,880
我以为你俩不和呢
I thought you two didn't get along.

1319
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,500
-没有  -你就是不喜欢我啊
- No. That's not so. - It's just me you don't care for.

1320
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,880
-不说话吗  -其实  正好你来了
- No? Nothing? - Actually, while you're here,

1321
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,270
或许你和娜塔莉可以谈一下
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the

1322
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,040
私人物品的事
matter of the personal belongings.

1323
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,170
没问题
Absolutely.

1324
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,040
你居然能忍住没说
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

1325

You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it?

你就直接破坏...你简直是三重骗子
You just tear things... You're a triple impostor.

我从没见过你这样的

你真会拉丁语吗
Do you even speak Latin?

什么意思  等等  什么
Which means? Wait. What?

1332

你说了什么
What did you just say?

1333

你要么自己开车回家
It means you can either drive yourself home

1334
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,060
要么我找人来接你

1335
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,040
你真厉害
You're good.

1342
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,180
你是明知故问  展示出来
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1343
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,070
你觉得那像什么  贾维斯
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

1344
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,100
挺像原子的
Not unlike an atom.

1345
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,450
那么原子核就在这里

我在发现  纠正
I'm discovering... Correction.

1351

我应该是在重发现一个新元素

还能教育我

1359
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:25,880
提议的元素应当可以

The drone is not going to be ready.

1399

1400
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:44,810
我可以做展示  而不是演示
I can make presentation, not demonstration.

1401
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:47,040
有什么差别
What the hell is the difference?

1402
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,770
展示  不飞  不射击
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1403
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,710
等等

这可是武器演示

1406

-我可以让它们致敬  -致敬
- I can make salute. - You can make salute?

1407
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:59,910
什么意思  "致敬"
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1408
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:02,080
那是什么意思  伊凡
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

1409
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,240
我们说好的可不是这样
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1410
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,830
你先是说能做战衣  然后又说能做无人机
You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.

1411
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:11,040
-一切都会没问题的  -我想要的不是这样
- Hey, man, everything will be okay. - This is not what I wanted.

他在这里呢  鸟人

1413
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:30,530
你喜欢那只鸟  是吗
Now you like the bird. Is that right?

1414
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,180
那是你的鸟吗  我都糊涂了
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1415
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,390
你之前说不是的  但现在看来关系好得很
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1416
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:38,990
你喜欢那只鸟  是吧
You love that bird, don't you?

1417
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:41,160
这样吧  把鸟拿走
You know what? Take the bird.

1418
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,170
还有他的枕头  两个都拿走
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1419

1420
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,530
我拿走了你的东西
I took your stuff.

1421
01:28:58,090 --> 01:29:01,310
你有什么感觉  难过吗
How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad?

1422
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,730
很好  因为那就是我的感觉
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1423
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,370
我们有合同的
We had a contract.

1424
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,740
我救你一命
I saved your life

1425
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,740
你给我战衣
and you give me suits.

1426
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:15,920
那是我们的协议
That was our deal.

1427
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:17,740
而你没能做到
And you did not deliver.

1428
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:21,490
我不知道你是天才还是骗子
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.

1429
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,000
我不知道你算什么
I don't know what you are.

1430
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,660
有很棒的东西恰好从天上掉进了我怀里
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

1431
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:32,960
否则  我今晚只能指望你的本事了
And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1432
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:37,150
我自己弄到了一件斯塔克的装置
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.

1433
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:38,760
现在  你价格过高的镇纸
And now your overpriced paperweights

1434
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,010
会变成我的演示的陪衬
are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1435
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,960
你明白我想说什么了吧
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1436
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:50,620
不知道你是否知道  但我不会说俄语
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!

1437
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,450
我要走了
I'm gonna leave now.

1438
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,360
我要去博览会  或许还能享享艳福
I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid.

1439
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,910
看到他们了吗  他们是你的保姆
You see these guys? They're your babysitters.

1440
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,930
你最好别惹他们
They are not to be trifled with.

1441
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,820
等我回来时  我们要重新商讨
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate

1442
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,690
我们协议的条款
the terms of our agreement.

1443
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:12,180
你要照协议办事
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement

1444
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,370
否则
because if you don't,

1445
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:15,990
你会回到我找到你时的状态
you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you,

1446
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,350
做个死人
a dead man.

1447
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,950
明白了吗
You got that?

1448
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:21,950
或许你可以在电视上看我
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1449
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:34,410
呆呆  可以把这里收拾了吗  你真要我命
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me.

1450
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:35,220
你知道我不...
You know I don't...

1451
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,740
屏蔽号码来电  先生
Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.

1452
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:40,520
我的通话权利被恢复了  太好了

科尔森  迷人之地怎么样

1454
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,420
托尼  你还好吗
Tony, how you doing?

1455
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:49,110
-我把转速翻倍了  -什么
- I double cycle. - You what?

1456
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:54,050
你说转速翻倍能量会更大  好建议
You told me double cycle's more power. Good advice.

1457
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:55,780
你不是都死了吗  还这么精神
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

1458
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,970
彼此彼此

我叫你留在车里了
I said, stay in the car.

1597

你穿的是什么
What are you wearing?

1598

我不会让你一个人进去的
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.

1599
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,120
你想帮忙吗  车别熄火
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1606
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:28,650
独特的语言沟通

1607

那就选一个  只用那个
Well, choose one and focus on that.

1613
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:42,510
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}是恶搞了一句军队俗语

1614

1628
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,170

我本想给你做个煎蛋卷顺便告诉你的
I was gonna make you an omelet and tell you.

When I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.

1643
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,190
-好吧  -我们本可以去威尼斯的

-托尼  对不起  -不用
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay? - Don't be.

1652
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,170
不  我本该更信任你的

1653
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:08,890
是我害你陷入了这样的局面  别想了
I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

They're coming in hot, any second. What's the play?

1657

我们得占领高地
Well, we want to take the high ground, okay?

1658
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,440
把火力最大的武器安排在山脊上
So let's put the biggest gun up on that ridge.

01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,940
-托尼  别嫉妒嘛  -不  真低调
- Tony, don't be jealous. - No. It's subtle,

All right. You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1668

- Where's mine? - It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?

1671
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,100
你会死在这里的
This is where you go to die.

01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,070
蹲下
Get down.

1675
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,480
下次你该先用那个

1676
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,280
嗯  抱歉  老大

I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1678
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:09,190
我五分钟前就说了
I told you that five minutes ago.

1679
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:11,990

This one looks different.

1698
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,340
冲击能量高得多

这些无人机都要爆炸了
All these drones are rigged to blow.

1715

害死自己  还是祸害整个公司
